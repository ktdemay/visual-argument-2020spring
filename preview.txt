In this preview, you don’t see much. I just began the process of piecing together my final picture. You can see the basic layout of the picture. The text at the top is going to be a main focal point of the piece, especially with the word here. your eyes will then move down to the pictures of the players which will all be cut out of their background. The background of this is the Philadelphia skyline. This piece will inspire the current generation of athletes and fans of Philadelphia sports and hopefully create a winning atmosphere in the city. I have picked the background image and the text is place where it will likely end up. I still have a lot of work to do, especially with cutting the players out of their backgrounds. That has been the most challenging part so far as I haven’t even finished cutting out the first player yet as you see in the preview. The picture of Joel Embiid will eventually be downsized and fit nicely under the H but it is bigger now to help cut him out of the background.


Moving forward, the next step will be to assemble all the players under the word ‘HERE’. There are four major professional teams in Philly so each team will be represented by the player best representing the teams future success and be placed under one of the letters. Then I will fill in the word ‘HERE’ with the logos of each team. Each letter will have a different team’s logo and will correspond to the athlete underneath that letter. I anticipate this step causing me the most trouble as I don’t have much picture editing experience and it seems like it will be a tough thing to accomplish. I have a good vision of the direction I want to follow with this project and I think I am on the right path.
